# Lecture 3: Version control with git and Github

![](img/Finaldoc.png)



This optional [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Gl97tkbHU) explains what is git and Github and how to get started.

## git

Git is a command-line software that tracks changes in code. Git is now widely used for software development from simple analysis code to complex climate models. When coupled with an online repository service, such as Github, git is a powerful tool for working collaboratively on coding projects. For example, numerical models such as [MOM6](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MOM6) and [MITgcm](https://github.com/MITgcm/MITgcm) are developed collaboratively on Github, with git as the version control software.



    cd MARN5895/Lectures/
    mkdir 03
    cd 03/

### Initializing git repository

Now ...

    mkdir planets
    cd planets

Now we initialize a git repository

    git init

... and generates a bunch of configuration files

    ls -a
    ls .git

### Tracking new files

### Creating branches



## Github
Github is an internet service for software development with git. It allows users to have remote repositories linked to local repositores, providing a cloud-based platform for storing and tracking changes to code.

### Raising issues

### Pull requests (PRs)


## In summary: the difference between git and Github





## Key points 

- `git` is a flexible... version control...

- `Github`

- `Github` is great tool for backing up, documenting, sharing code.
