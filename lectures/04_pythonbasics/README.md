# Lecture 4: Python basics


## Why Python?

Python was developed by a computer scientist and is a general-purpose language. It has a simple syntax
and runs efficiently.

[Eric Firing](https://github.com/efiring), a geeky oceanographer who contributed code to many widely used scientific Python packages, lists 
a number of reasons to use Python instead of Matlab:

1. Python is fundamentally a better computer language in many ways.

    * It is suitable for a wider variety of tasks.
    * It scales better from the shortest of scripts to large software projects.
    * It facilitates writing clearer and more concise code.
    * With associated tools, it makes for easier access to existing high-performance codes in compiled languages, and for using smaller pieces of compiled code to speed up     critical sections.

2. Because Python is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), you can install it on any machine without having to deal with a license manager.

3. For the same reason, Python code that is part of a research project can be run by anyone, anywhere, to verify or extend the results.

4. Most Python packages you are likely to want to use are developed in an open environment. The scientific Python ecosystem is dynamic and friendly.




Cesar began using Python when he started his Ph.D. in 2013. For data analysis, he used to code in Matlab. He was passionate about open science and wanted people 
everywhere to be able to verify his research results and build on his work (Firing's reason 3). It wasn't an easy transtion back then, because his advisor and most of his friends and colleagues in graduate school used Matlab, whose most primitive version was developed by geophysicists at IGPP/Scipps.  He got through it with the help 
of then-postdoc [Jinbo Wang](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/jwang2/) and the wonderful online Python community. Today, Python is probably the programming language most widely used in Data Science applications. In the 2-minute segment of video starting [here](https://youtu.be/gJd-Ohf1FfM?t=1145), physical oceanographer James Munroe explains why Python is probably the most effective programming language for scientific applications. The full video is recommended if you wish to have an overview about "Big Data Oceanography".  There exist many high-quality Python packages for Earth and Marine Sciences mainted by a community of developers in the US and elsewhere. We will several core Python packages and scientific Python packages in the remainder of this course. Your assignments and final projects will use these packages to download, read, and visualize Marine Science data.


## Invoking Python

  1. Running a script
  2. The standard python interpreter
  3. An enhanced python interpreter
  4. The Jupyter notebook

### Running a script

`myfirstscript.py`

## Basic operations





## Key points 

- Python is a powerful and versatile scripting language.

- Because of its multi-purpose nature, Python is widely used in scientific
  applications.

- The most basic Python data type are: lists, tuples.
