# Lecture 4: Python basics

This optional [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Gl97tkbHU) explains what is git and Github and how to get started.

## Python vs. Matlab

Python was developed by a computer scientist and is a general-purpose language. It has a simple syntax
and runs efficiently.

[Eric Firing](https://github.com/efiring), a geeky oceanographer who contributed code to many widely scientific Python packages, lists 
a number of reasons to use Python instead of Matlab:

1. Python is fundamentally a better computer language in many ways.

    a. It is suitable for a wider variety of tasks.
    b. It scales better from the shortest of scripts to large software projects.
    c. It facilitates writing clearer and more concise code.
    d. With associated tools, it makes for easier access to existing high-performance codes in compiled languages, and for using smaller pieces of compiled code to speed up     critical sections.

2. Because Python is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), you can install it on any machine without having to deal with a license manager.

3. For the same reason, Python code that is part of a research project can be run by anyone, anywhere, to verify or extend the results.

4. Most Python packages you are likely to want to use are developed in an open environment. The scientific Python ecosystem is dynamic and friendly.


Cesar began using Python when he started his Ph.D. in 2013. For data analysis, he used to code in Matlab. He was passionate about open science and wanted people 
everything to be able to verify his research results and build on his work (Firing's reason 3). It wasn't easy to make the transtion back then, because most of his 
friends and colleagues in graduate school used Matlab, whose most primitive version was developed by Geophysicists at IGPP/Scipps.  He got through it with the help 
of then postdoc [Jinbo Wang](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/jwang2/) and the wonderful online Python community. Today most Oceanography graduate students in the US use Python, because Python is the ...


## Invoking Python

  1. Running a script
  2. The standard python interpreter
  3. An enhanced python interpreter
  4. The Jupyter notebook

### Running a script

`myfirstscript.py`

## Basic operations





## Key points 

- Python is a powerful and versatile scripting language.

- Because of its multi-purpose nature, Python is widely used in scientific
  applications.

- The most basic Python data type are: lists, tuples.
