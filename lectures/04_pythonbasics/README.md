# Lecture 4: Python basics

This optional [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Gl97tkbHU) explains what is git and Github and how to get started.

## Python vs. Matlab

Python was developed by a computer scientist and is a general-purpose language. It has a simple syntax
and runs efficiently.

[Eric Firing](https://github.com/efiring), a geeky oceanographer who contributed code to many scientific Python packages, lists 
a number of reasons to use Python instead of Matlab:

1. Python is fundamentally a better computer language in many ways.

  a. It is suitable for a wider variety of tasks.
  b. It scales better from the shortest of scripts to large software projects.
  c. It facilitates writing clearer and more concise code.
  d. With associated tools, it makes for easier access to existing high-performance codes in compiled languages, and for using smaller pieces of compiled code to speed up     critical sections.

2. Because Python is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), you can install it on any machine without having to deal with a license manager.

3. For the same reason, Python code that is part of a research project can be run by anyone, anywhere, to verify or extend the results.

4. Most Python packages you are likely to want to use are developed in an open environment. The scientific Python ecosystem is dynamic and friendly.


Here's why Cesar began using Python and never turned back:

1. Python is [free and open software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html).
2. Python is the official language of Data Science.
3. The online Python community is wonderful and supportive.


## Invoking Python

  1. Running a script
  2. The standard python interpreter
  3. An enhanced python interpreter
  4. The Jupyter notebook

### Running a script

`myfirstscript.py`

## Basic operations





## Key points 

- Python is a powerful and versatile scripting language.

- Because of its multi-purpose nature, Python is widely used in scientific
  applications.

- The most basic Python data type are: lists, tuples.
