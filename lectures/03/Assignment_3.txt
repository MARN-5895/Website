Step 1: Install miniconda in your home directory
Miniconda is a mini version of Anaconda that includes just conda (the package manager) and some elementary Python packages. We will download an installation script and run it on Storrs HPC. First, log into Storrs HPC:

ssh NetID@login.storrs.hpc.uconn.edu
Where NetID is your UConn username. Now you are landed in you home directory on an Storrs HPC access node. To check that, you can type the command pwd (print current directory), which should return:

/home/NetID/
You should now run the bash script launch_bash_slurm_marn5895.sh to move into a work node dedicated to this course:

bash launch_bash_slurm_marn5895.sh
We now will download the miniconda Linux installation script, available from the company that developed and distributes the Anaconda package. (Remember that Storrs HPC uses a Linux Operating System.) The script is available online at https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/. To download a file directly from an URL, we use the command wget (Web get):

wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
The flag -O above is changing the name of the downloaded file (the output) to miniconda.sh. The download may take several seconds to complete.
