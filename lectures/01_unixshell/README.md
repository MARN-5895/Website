# Lesson 1: Introduction to the class, the Unix shell and Storrs HPC

## Welcome to Research Computing in Marine Sciences
Welcome to Research Computing in Marine Sciences! This course help
you learn modern computing tools for research, with application in Marine Sciences.
You will learn how to navigate the file system using the terminal, analyze and visualize
data in Python, and work collaboratively using git and Github.

All our work will take place at Storrs High-Performance Computing (HPC) facility.
By now, you should have an account at Storrs HPC and your netID should be linked
to the MARN-5895 class partition. Working on StorrsHPC has the advantage of ensuring
that all students have access to the same computer system and programs, regardless of
the operating system of their personal computer. Plus, you will gain relevant experience
working remotely on a Unix-based supercomputer.

## Getting to know the Unix shell

The shell is a program where users can type commands. With the shell, it’s possible to invoke complicated programs like climate modeling software or simple commands that create an empty directory with only one line of code. The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne Again SHell — so-called because it’s derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne). Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.

Using the shell will take some effort and some time to learn. While a GUI presents you with choices to select, CLI choices are not automatically presented to you, so you must learn a few commands like new vocabulary in a language you’re studying. However, unlike a spoken language, a small number of “words” (i.e. commands) gets you a long way, and we’ll cover those essential few today.

The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into powerful pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. Sequences of commands can be written into a script, improving the reproducibility of workflows.

In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines and supercomputers. Familiarity with the shell is near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources including high-performance computing systems. As clusters and cloud computing systems become more popular for scientific data crunching, being able to interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill. We can build on the command-line skills covered here to tackle a wide range of scientific questions and computational challenges.


### Linux and MacOS users
Both Linux and MacOS are Unix-based operating systems, and the Unix shell is a
native application. The most common Unix shell application is called `Terminal`.


### Windows users
For Windows users I recommend the Unix terminal that come with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com),
a Microsoft text edit that has become the go-to tool for software developers. VSCode
also works on Linux and MacOS.

## Logging into Storrs HPC

```Bash
ssh YourNetID@login.storrs.hpc.uconn.edu
```


## Key points

  - This course aims to empower you to use modern computer software to solve research problems in Marine Sciences.
  - The terminal or Unix shell is an application for the user to interact with the computer.
  - Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol used to access remote computers.
