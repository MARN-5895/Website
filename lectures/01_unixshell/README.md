# Lesson 1: Introduction to the class, the Unix shell and Storrs HPC

## Welcome to Research Computing in Marine Sciences
Welcome to Research Computing in Marine Sciences! This course help
you learn modern computing tools for research, with application in Marine Sciences.
You will learn how to navigate the file system using the terminal, anallyze and visualize
data in Python, and ...

All our work will take place at Storrs High-Performance Computing (HPC) facility.
By now, you should have an account at Storrs HPC and your netID should be linked
to the MARN-5895 class partition. Working on StorrsHPC has the advantage of ensuring
that all students have access to the same computer system and programs, regardless of
the operating system of their personal computer. Plus, you will gain relevant experience
about working remotely on a Unix-based supercomputer.
