# Final project

The course's final project accounts for half of the course grade. It should involve obtaining, 
processing, and visualizing a largish dataset (see some suggestions below) using the tools 
learned in the course and expand upon. In consultation with me, student pairs or small
groups should choose their dataset by week 7. The final project must be well documented and 
shared on a Github repository. The other students in the class and I should
be able to clone your repository and reproduce your work as you present your work in the final week of classes.

Please, discuss with your pair/small group add your names and dataset to the course's GoogleDoc spreadsheet.
