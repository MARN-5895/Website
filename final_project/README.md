# Final project

The course's final project accounts for half of the course grade. It should involve obtaining, 
processing, and visualizing a largish dataset (see some suggestions below) using the tools 
learned in the course and expand upon. This is not an individual assignment––students will be working in 
small groups (5 pairs and one group of 3). Students are free to choose their groups. Remember the adage, ``If you want to go quickly, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.''


In consultation with me, student 
small group should choose their dataset by week 7. The final project must be well documented and 
shared on a Github repository. The other students in the class and I should
be able to clone your repository and reproduce your work as you present your work in the final week of classes. You presentation/demo 
should introduce the class to a new dataset or tool or trick.

Please, discuss with your pair/small group add your names and dataset to the course's GoogleDoc spreadsheet.
