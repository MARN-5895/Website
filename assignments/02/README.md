# Assignment 2: Automating tasks using the Unix terminal

## Step 1: Launch a terminal shell on a jupyterlab running on Storrs HPC

Following the set up commands learned in [Lecture 2](../lectures/02/README.md), set up jupyterlab service and tunnel it to your local browser.

Now start a terminal on `jupyterlab` and navigate into Nelle's North Pacific Gyre directory:

    cd data-shell/north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03

## Step 2: Add a prefix NPG to all `.txt` files in this directory
This directory contains protein sample data (the `.txt` files) and an analysis script (`goostats.sh`) written by Nelle's advisor. Nelle realized that the data files generated by her advisor have generic names. She reasons that it would be good to tag those filenames with North Pacific Gyre, in case she wants to compare protein sample data across different ocean basins. 

Of course you could do this by hand, one f. But that's too much work, and it is prone to human error. You job is to automate this task using the terminal shell. Write a shell script that appends the orefx `NPG` (for North Pacific Gyre) to all protein sample data.

## Step 3: Run shell script `goostats.sh`


## Step 4: Check results?
