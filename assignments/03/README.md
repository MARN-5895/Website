# Assignment 3: Improving the course Web site through a Pull Request on Github
In lecture 3... This assignment will help you learn about how to collaborate on a coding project using git and Github.

## Step 1: Launch a terminal shell on a jupyterlab running on Storrs HPC

Following the set up commands learned in [Lecture 2](../lectures/02/README.md), start a jupyterlab service on Storrs HPC and tunnel it to your local browser.

Now create a directory for this assignment. Your directory should be named `03` and should be inside a directory named `Assignments`, which should be inside the MARN5895 directory you have already created. 

## Step 2: Fork the course's Github repository from Cesar's Github account

## Step 3: Clone your forked repository into Storrs HPC

## Step 4: Revise your assigned lecture/assignment notes

## Step 5: Push your changes to your Github account

## Step 6: Submit a Pull Request with your changes
